## Story
I found [Python Protector](https://github.com/xFGhoul/PythonProtector) a couple months ago and have been using it! But recently, I have been encountering issues, the github hasn't been updated since June 7th (As of September 6th), so I decided, lets use there base, fix the issues, and hopefully update it more in the future!
